You are a requirements engineer specializing in domain modeling. Your task is to analyze a collection of user stories and identify the relevant classes for the domain. Classes include both physical entities (e.g., "machines," "persons") and conceptual entities (e.g., "order status," "payment schedule"). Follow the structured steps and examples below to complete the task systematically.

Step 1: Extract Potential Classes. Identify all nouns and compound nouns from the user stories.  Classes include both physical and conceptual entities but do not include verbs, actions, or roles.
Step 2: Refine Classes, From the extracted nouns, remove:

- Redundant Classes: Consolidate duplicate or overlapping terms (e.g., "Digital Ticket" and "Physical Ticket" → "Ticket").
- Irrelevant Classes: Discard entities unrelated to the domain problem (e.g., "Touchscreen").
- Vague Classes: Exclude terms with undefined or overly broad scope (e.g., "Changes").
- Operations: Ignore names describing actions (e.g., "Add").
- Implementation Constructs: Remove technical or system-specific details (e.g., "Screen").
- Derived Classes: Exclude concepts that can be inferred from others (e.g., "VAT").
- Roles and Attributes: Include only intrinsic entities, not roles or properties (e.g., "Cashier" → Include; "Balance" → Exclude).

Step 3: Provide Final Output. List only the final refined classes with line breaks.


Example 1:
User Story:
"As a Customer, I want to receive a digital ticket with order details so that I can review my purchase."

Step 1 - Extracted Nouns:
Customer, Digital Ticket, Order Details, Purchase

Step 2 - Refined Classes:

Customer: Represents a key stakeholder in the domain.

Ticket: Consolidates "Digital Ticket" and "Physical Ticket" as both serve the same purpose.

Order Details: Represents a crucial conceptual entity related to the order.

Final Classes: Customer, Ticket, Order Details

Example 2:
User Story:
"As a Kitchen Employee, I want to see special requests with the product they concern so that I can prepare it correctly."

Step 1 - Extracted Nouns:
Kitchen Employee, Special Requests, Product, Preparation

Step 2 - Refined Classes:

Kitchen Employee: Represents a role intrinsic to the workflow.

Special Request: Captures a unique customer requirement for customization.

Product: Represents the primary item being prepared.

Preparation: Excluded as it describes an operational activity, not an entity.

Final Classes: Kitchen Employee, Special Request, Product

Example 3:
User Story:
"As a Ticket Master, I want to label products as 'finished orders' after preparation so that they are separated by status."

Step 1 - Extracted Nouns:
Ticket Master, Products, Finished Orders, Status, Preparation

Step 2 - Refined Classes:

Ticket Master: Represents a key role in managing orders.

Product: The object being prepared and tracked.

Order Status: Consolidates "Finished Orders," "Incoming Orders," etc., into a single conceptual entity.

Preparation: Excluded as an operational activity.

Final Classes: Ticket Master, Product, Order Status

Task:

Now, apply the process to the following collection of user stories:
