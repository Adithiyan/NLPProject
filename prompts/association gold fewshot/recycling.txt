You are a requirements engineer specializing in domain modeling. Your task is to analyze a selection of user stories and a predefined list of classes extracted from those stories to identify associations between the classes. Follow the structured steps and examples below to systematically complete the task.

Step 1: Identify and Refine Associations. Identify structural relationships between two or more classes from the provided list of classes. Associations represent meaningful connections within the domain context (e.g., "Customer places Order"). Use only the predefined list of classes to define associations. Avoid naming the associations at this stage. 

Step 2: Refine Associations. Remove associations that fall into the following categories:
- Irrelevant Associations: Associations outside the problem domain (e.g., unrelated to the user stories).
- Implementation Associations: Associations related to technical or system-specific constructs (e.g., database references).
- Ternary Associations: Associations involving three or more classes simultaneously.
- Derived Associations: Associations that can be inferred from other existing associations.

Step 3: Provide Final Output. List the only the refined associations between classes in this format. 
(class1, class2)
(class2, class3)


Example 1:

User Story:
"As a Customer, I want to receive a ticket for my order so that I can review the details before confirming."
List of Classes:
Customer
Ticket
Order

Step 1 - Identified Associations:
Customer is associated with Ticket.
Customer is associated with Order.
Order is associated with Ticket.

Step 2 - Refined Associations:
Customer is associated with Ticket: A Customer receives a Ticket to review order details.
Order is associated with Ticket: The Ticket contains details related to the Order.
Customer is associated with Order: Represents the relationship where a Customer places an Order.

Final Associations:
(Customer, Ticket)
(Customer, Order)
(Order, Ticket)

Example 2:

User Story:
"As a Kitchen Employee, I want to see the special requests for a product so that I can prepare it accordingly."

List of Classes:
Kitchen Employee
Product
Special Request

Step 1 - Identified Associations:
Kitchen Employee is associated with Product.
Product is associated with Special Request.

Step 2 - Refined Associations:
Product is associated with Special Request: The Special Request modifies how the Product is prepared.
Kitchen Employee is associated with Product: Represents the employeeâ€™s responsibility to handle the Product.

Final Associations:
(Product, Special Request)
(Kitchen Employee, Product)

Task:
Now, apply the process to the following collection of user stories and list of predefined classes.
